Hi there, I am a senior postgraduate student 👨‍🎓 from School of Computer Science, South China Normal University.

I am generally interested in **data mining and machine learning**, especially recommendation system, with supervised, AutoML or transfer learning approaches. And I focus on using latest techniques to build machines that collecting, analysing and using data, help humans to find their favourite items, detect patterns and mining interesting results.

<!-- I have been working at CAD&CG State Key Lab of ZJU with Prof. Xiaogang Jin since my sophomore year.  -->
This past summer, I have spent great time as a **Machine Learning Intern at *[CloudBrain](http://www.cloudbrain.ai/)* **, participated in two projects in cooperation with *vivo* and *CCB*.
<!-- Now I am working on Design2code under the supervision of Prof. Fei Wu at Institute of Artificial Intelligence of Zhejiang University with Alibaba. -->
